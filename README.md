# Short-URL

The goals of this app is to build out a landing page, integrate with the [rel.ink](https://rel.ink) API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

We will be using the following to accomplish this project:

- React (`npx lambda-react .`)
- axios
- styled-components
- useState
- LocalStorage
- yup
- cypress
- font awesome
- IcoMoon
- Ionicons
- more as we come to it ...

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
